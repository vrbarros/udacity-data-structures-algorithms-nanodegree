The best approach uses tree data structures and recursion in each node. 

For the find method we have time complexity O(n) and space complexity O(1) once that each character needs to be iterated.

For the insert method we have time complexity O(n) and space complexity O(n).

For the suffixes method we have time complexity O(n) and space complexity O(1) once that no memory is allocated.
