Calculate Big O

Task0.py
Time - Complexity: O(1)
Analysis: Only has an input, no complexity

Task1.py 
Time - Complexity: O(n)
Analysis: Two lists are looped once each O(n)

Task2.py 
Time - Complexity: O(n)
Analysis: One list is looped through once, max func. usage one time O(n)

Task3.py 
Time - Complexity: O(nlogn)
Analysis: For loop with regex O(n), sort O(nlogn) and reduce O(nlogn)

Task4.py 
Time - Complexity: O(nlogn)
Analysis: For loop O(n) and sort O(nlogn)
